Website color changes every 2 seconds to a random color
In this code, the background color of the <body> element changes every 2 seconds to a random color from the colors array. A transition effect is applied to provide a smooth color change. The transition class is added to the <body> element briefly to trigger the transition effect and then removed after 500ms.

Feel free to modify the code to include additional colors, adjust the timing, or customize the styling to suit your preferences.
